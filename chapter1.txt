The forest was dead with a symphony of whispers, a melody carried by the wind through the towering pines and ancient oaks. Elara stepped cautiously, her lantern casting flickering shadows on the moss-covered ground. She had heard the talesâ€”a place where the boundaries between reality and dreams dissolved, where those who entered either returned changed or never returned at all. Her fingers brushed against the hilt of her dagger, more for comfort than defense. The map her father had left her hinted that her destiny lay beyond the stream that hummed with an unearthly glow. "Find the Heart of the Woods," the old parchment demanded, though no one knew what it was. A sudden rustle in the undergrowth made her freeze. Two golden eyes stared back at her, unblinking and unafraid. "You're not supposed to be here," a voice, neither human nor animal, whispered through the trees. Elara tightened her grip on the lantern, knowing she was already too far to turn back.
