Elara's heart pounded, her breath visible in the icy air. The golden eyes blinked, and a figure stepped into the glow of her lantern—a man cloaked in shadow, his face obscured by a hood. "You carry the map," he said, his voice low and gravelly. She nodded cautiously, gripping the parchment tighter. "Who are you?" she demanded. He didn’t answer, instead pointing toward the stream. "The Heart of the Woods isn’t a treasure; it’s a curse. Turn back now while you can." Elara hesitated, but the faint hum of the stream grew louder, like a heartbeat calling her. "I have to know," she said firmly, stepping forward. The man sighed, his silhouette shifting as though melting into the night. "Then may the woods have mercy on you." Moments later, he was gone, leaving Elara alone once more—except for the eyes watching her from the shadows.
