The stream pulsed with an otherworldly light, its waters swirling like liquid stars. Elara knelt at its edge, the map trembling in her hands. The words seemed to shift and twist before her eyes: Offer your truth to claim the Heart. “What does that mean?” she whispered. A soft glow rose from the center of the stream, forming a figure—a reflection of herself, but with eyes that glowed like embers. “It means surrender,” the reflection said, her voice a haunting echo. “Your past, your pain, your fear. Only then will you be free.” Elara hesitated, memories flooding her: the father who vanished in these woods, the nights spent searching, the years lost to grief. Slowly, she unclasped the pendant he’d given her, the last tie to her old life, and let it fall into the water. The woods erupted in light, the trees shouting in unison. The reflection smiled, fading into the stream as the glow engulfed Elara. When it faded, she stood alone, the forest silent, her heart calm for the first time in years. The map was gone, but she didn’t need it anymore. She turned and walked away, the woods behind her, the weight of the past lifted at last.
